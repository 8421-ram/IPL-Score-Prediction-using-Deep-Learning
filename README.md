# IPL Score Prediction using Deep Learning

![IPL Score Prediction](https://res.cloudinary.com/dgwuwwqom/image/upload/v1730724141/Github/IPL_Score_predict_using_deeplearning.webp)

## Overview
This project aims to predict the total score of IPL matches using deep learning techniques. By leveraging historical match data, we build a neural network model to analyze various features such as venue, teams, and players' performance. The model can be used to forecast scores, providing valuable insights for teams and fans alike.

## Steps to Build the Model

### Step 1: Import Libraries
We begin by importing necessary libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and TensorFlow/Keras.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn import preprocessing
import keras 
import tensorflow as tf 
```

### Step 2: Load the Dataset
We load the IPL dataset, which includes match data from 2008 to 2017. The dataset contains features like venue, date, teams, players, runs, and wickets.

```python
ipl = pd.read_csv('ipl_dataset.csv')
ipl.head()
```

### Step 3: Data Preprocessing
- **Dropping Unnecessary Features**: We drop columns that do not contribute to our predictive model.
  
  ```python
  df = ipl.drop(['date', 'runs', 'wickets', 'overs', 'runs_last_5', 'wickets_last_5','mid', 'striker', 'non-striker'], axis=1)
  ```
  
- **Splitting Data**: The dataset is split into independent variables (X) and the target variable (y).

  ```python
  X = df.drop(['total'], axis=1)
  y = df['total']
  ```
  
- **Label Encoding**: We encode categorical features using `LabelEncoder`.

- **Train-Test Split**: The data is split into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets.

- **Feature Scaling**: We apply Min-Max scaling to normalize the feature set.

### Step 4: Define the Neural Network
A neural network model is defined using Keras, optimized for regression tasks with Huber loss.

```python
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Input(shape=(X_train_scaled.shape[1],)),
    keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(216, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='linear')
])
```

### Step 5: Model Training
The model is trained on the scaled training data for 50 epochs.

```python
model.fit(X_train_scaled, y_train, epochs=50, batch_size=64, validation_data=(X_test_scaled, y_test))
```

### Step 6: Model Evaluation
Predictions are made on the testing data, and performance metrics like Mean Absolute Error are calculated.

```python
predictions = model.predict(X_test_scaled)
mean_absolute_error(y_test, predictions)
```

### Step 7: Interactive Widget
An interactive widget is created using `ipywidgets`, allowing users to input match scenarios and receive score predictions.

```python
import ipywidgets as widgets
# Widget code...
```

## Conclusion
The application of deep learning in IPL score prediction represents a significant advancement in cricket analytics. This model not only aids strategic decision-making during matches but also enhances the fan experience by delivering real-time insights. As technology progresses, cricket analytics is set to become more data-driven, providing deeper insights into the game.
